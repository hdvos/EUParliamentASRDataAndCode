009_20140714.wav.pcm	17	okay, thank you for putting your objection so politely and effectively, that’s noted and we will move on to the first statement of mister slobodan, thank you mister chairman, I would also	32	1.88235294117647
010_20140714.wav.pcm	20	I would also, I would also like to greet the members of the JURI committee, LIBE committee and the FEMM committee, but first of all also madam Martine Reicherts the comissionary designate	32	1.6
011_20140714.wav.pcm	19	I would like to stress that the cooperation between our committees is very important because there are areas of common interest among us, there are also areas of responsibility of the commissional designate	33	1.73684210526316
012_20140714.wav.pcm	15	that overlap with the field of, of responsibility of the JURI committee, namely the field of civil justice including family law and private international law	25	1.66666666666667
013_20140714.wav.pcm	21	and these are the areas that the JURI members are going to focus in their questions, I am sure madam that after your election the cooperation with yourself is going to be as fruitfull as it was in the past with madam Reding when she was	46	2.19047619047619
014_20140714.wav.pcm	20	in office, being short of time let me just pass the floor to madam Garcia Perez from the FEMM committee thank you, thank you very much chairman, good afternoon to all colleagues, and of course	35	1.75
016_20140714.wav.pcm	28	it is one that is, that characterizes all European policy making and we believe that gender equality is absolutely fundamental as is fighting against gender based violence and several different dossiers such as maternity leave and the dossier on women on the the boards of (…) is, are all all extremely fundamental, the difficulties that women are fighting	58	2.07142857142857
017_20140714.wav.pcm	21	in these times of crisis, particularly matters relating to sexual and reproductive health and rights, these are key issues for women and we believe the various questions that the coordinators will reflect that over the course of this afternoon, I won’t take up any more time, lets move on to the speakers from the different committees that will have the floor, thank you	63	3
018_20140714.wav.pcm	17	thank you very much, Rachi, and madame Reichert, we now have the opening of the questions, you are going to be making an initial statement, for the LIBE committee obvious fundamental rights portfolio is extremely important and you are gonna make a 	43	2.52941176470588
064_20140723.wav.pcm	17	well, I mean, we are talking  twenty nine percent or one percent, that doesn’t really mean a lot to me, I’d really like to understand a little bit more about it, and I also would like to know what kind of effects these kind of controls have.	48	2.82352941176471
065_20140723.wav.pcm	25	for a few years I was also an employer, I was the director of a company and the quantity of the inspections doesn’t necessarily give you an idea of whether people are working legally or illegally, I’d like to know how these controls actually take place	46	1.84
066_20140723.wav.pcm	21	 misses brjork, well on behalf of the GUE ngl group	11	0.523809523809524
067_20140723.wav.pcm	17	we feel that the background of this directive is very difficult for us, the legal basis, means, is about fighting illegal immigration as it’s put	25	1.47058823529412
068_20140723.wav.pcm	21	I am glad that the, inside the directive we are strengthening migrants rights, but when the commission talks about the various challenges that exist in implementing the directive, the problem is precisely in the area of workers rights	38	1.80952380952381
069_20140723.wav.pcm	16	we have contacted a number of organizations that work in, with people in a similar situation and they say that the risks are great, first of all, that you get punished by your employer as a result.	37	2.3125
070_20140723.wav.pcm	22	that you are exposed to ehm, to imprisonment or deportation and you are also expected to ehm, wel you might be in the danger of being handed in by your employer	31	1.40909090909091
071_20140723.wav.pcm	17	now, it has been very difficult for some of these workers to get unpaid wages and things like that after they have fallen victim to this kind of situation, so it is important that we should be strengthening the rights for undocumented immigrants	43	2.52941176470588
072_20140723.wav.pcm	23	that‘s the key thing, while you are talking about more controls and more sanctions, that’s not necessarily the most effective way of dealing with undeclared work, the most effective way is of course to strengthen workers rights so that they are in the condition to actually report employers that exploit them	51	2.21739130434783
399_20140723.wav.pcm	22	as regards to this first plea the court then expressed itself for the first time on the exclusivity clause and found that this provision of the Lisbon treaty  may be interpreted in different ways and supported here the interpretation which corresponds to the internal division of power of EU institution linking it to the, directly to the legal basis issue as well	63	2.86363636363636
448_20140904.wav.pcm	28	about fundamental rights, does it bring about any concern about the the consistency of democracy and rule of law, is there any concern about those processes of increasing the demand of self government or even claims of independence or statehood, there are some regions which are undergoing that kind of … processing across Europe, when it comes to the consistency of the rule of law and the democratic principles	69	2.46428571428571
449_20140904.wav.pcm	18	and, finally I would like to get to know about the point of prisons, about the prisons, because the economic crisis, because the austerity policy has brought about a lot of deterioration of prison conditions in a number of member states of the European Union	45	2.5
450_20140904.wav.pcm	29	I had the experience of chairing, just, I’m finishing, chairing a delegation to Italy, we saw Poggioreale in in in in in, near Napolis, near Naples, and and that was a really outrageous situation, any concern about the prison situation when it comes to it’s impact on torture, ill mistreatment on on on convicts in the prison system across Europe, thank you, thank you, misses IN 'T VELD	68	2.3448275862069
451_20140904.wav.pcm	15	yes thank you chair, and I apologize in advance for not being able to stay until the end of this session, listening to these three presentation I get the impression that we are not talking about the same planet.	39	2.6
452_20140904.wav.pcm	21	if I listen to the description of the situation of fundamental rights by the two gentlemen, and then the answer of the commission saying you know everything is fine, everything is under control, I really wonder if we are talking about the same thing, and it is typical because, and I I’ve said this many times before, I find	59	2.80952380952381
453_20140904.wav.pcm	19	the attitude of the European commission in standing up for fundamental rights extremely disappointing, and I am I am expressing myself very very carefully. If missus … rightfully says, that the charter of fundamental rights should be, and I quote, realité tangible pour les citoyens	45	2.36842105263158
454_20140904.wav.pcm	17	I don’t think that there is any citizen who feels that the European Commission has defended their fundamental rights over the past five years, I mean, listen to the examples given by the two gentlemen missus Lebaix.	37	2.17647058823529
455_20140904.wav.pcm	17	Have the people they are talking about been defended, protected by the commission? No they have not, because the commission has been extremely timid in intervening in the member states violating fundamental rights. One of the many examples was just	40	2.35294117647059
456_20140904.wav.pcm	18	mentioned by my colleague. I think there was another remark ascribed to mister Orbán, who said that we don’t need immigration anymore, because there are ten million Roma people that we have for doing the dirty and the heavy work. I would like to know the position of the commission of such	52	2.88888888888889
457_20140904.wav.pcm	17	remarks, and I would also like to know if the commission continues to refuse to propose an lgbti roadmap. And I would really like to know what the commission will do, finally, to start protecting the privacy of European citizens, and I conclude	43	2.52941176470588
001_20140915.wav.pcm	27	so that’s good, okay colleagues, if there are no objections, the agenda is adopted, missus Spinelli do you have an objection? Please go ahead for one minute.	27	1
002_20140915.wav.pcm	18	yes, I would like to raise a point regarding procedure	10	0.555555555555556
003_20140915.wav.pcm	16	our group has obviously been promoting equal treatment of workers, the point of criticism I want to make pertains to procedure	21	1.3125
004_20140915.wav.pcm	20	and, what I’d like to ask you is this, could we add to the agenda, an additional point where we could have a democratic discussion about what is happening in Ukraine	31	1.55
005_20140915.wav.pcm	18	this is a very very important topic, and I think we haven’t had a proper discussion on it yet, and I think it is important that we draw the attention of members of parliament to the fact that this agreement could have major, a major impact	46	2.55555555555556
006_20140915.wav.pcm	26	in a situation which is tantamount to civil war, that there is a lot of international attention on Ukraine at the moment, I think we need to be concious about that, thank you. Okay thank you for making the point so succinctly , ehm I am glad somebody raised the point, I think the substantive point you are making is that we are gonna have a vote, albeit one electronic vote on the Ukraine association agreement.	76	2.92307692307692
007_20140915.wav.pcm	28	I was going to make the point later, but I can make the point now, in relation to your point of order. I share your concern, which is that this report was lead by the AFET committee and not by the LIBE committee, there are some colleagues here who are from the AFET committee, and can confirm this, we are associated with it on some very important issues, colleagues here present, will have worked on some Ukraine issues, as I have	81	2.89285714285714
008_20140915.wav.pcm	16	In the last mandate, ehm, and it’s not ideal that we are in a situation where we will have a plenary debate tomorrow, and we won’t have a substantive debate today. Anything with the label Ukraine is politically charged, so I share your concerns	44	2.75
009_20140915.wav.pcm	22	and of your group. So we are not in an Ideal position, but I don’t think procedurally we are in a position to open a debate today. If you have serious concerns, then obviously you should reflect them in the vote today, and I am happy for you to do that. But we won’t be in the a position today, and I think that all groups are aware of the vote today	72	3.27272727272727
010_20140915.wav.pcm	27	Where we would have to have a debate so, but I do share the concerns and I think you are right to raise then, for your group to raise them, so if there are no other objections, I don’t want to open a debate on it today so, I think that a lot of colleagues and substitutes have come just for the vote today and I have a number of other announcements. So with that point being well raised I think I will move on. 	86	3.18518518518519
039_20140925.wav.pcm	17	There is the high number of new psycho active substances notified for the early warning system, I said eighty one last year seventy eight this year by today. The development of … indicate that it is an important task of the agency and requires a lot of resources.	48	2.82352941176471
040_20140925.wav.pcm	16	we receive more request for contributions to key meetings giving speeches and presentations. We have more visits to the EMCD headquarters just give you an example, this week before I left the agency yesterday we already had the justice committee of the Danish parliament.	44	2.75
041_20140925.wav.pcm	25	state secretaries from Portugal of Hungary, and we had a visit of the president of the European parliament Martin Schultz, all these in the first three days of this week, and this is not an exception, in this context, I am sure it is not a surprise for you that by the end of two thousand thirteen, ninetinine point seven four per cent of the budget had been committed of this agency	72	2.88
042_20140925.wav.pcm	22	let me just say a few words about the future if you allow me at the moment we are developing our next (…) extensive consultation exercise, which involved our key stakeholders. 	32	1.45454545454545
043_20140925.wav.pcm	16	Ex stakeholders and partners, including obviously our stakeholders from the European parliament and we also consulted the general public. Our overall goal will be to contribute to a more secure and healthier europe	33	2.0625
044_20140925.wav.pcm	28	and we will do that by strengthening our monitoring system which is built on the data collected from the national focal points in the twenty eight member states in Norway and Turkey, and we will do that by describing and analyzing the (…) from both a supply and demand perspective. And there will be an increased focus on monitoring the drug use and developing a framework for monitoring the misuse of medicines.	72	2.57142857142857
045_20140925.wav.pcm	16	during two thousand sixteen to eighteen, we will also enhance our capacity to provide evidence for action through further investment in the area of responses to drug use, in particular, best practices. And we will further improve the timeliness of our information.	42	2.625
046_20140925.wav.pcm	26	through the ongoing management of the early warning system on new drugs, in line with a new legislat legislative framework which is expected to replace the current decision, which was mentioned already, and we will further invest in the EMCVA’s thread assessment capacity,  which includes waste water and (…) analysis, and obviously the early warning system that I have already mentioned. Ladies and gentlemen, after four years	68	2.61538461538462
048_20140925.wav.pcm	18	and I mentioned already that we had a visit from martin Schultz the day before yesterday in Lisbon, and in a press conference in Lisbon, the president of the parliament stressed the need for an increasing, for increasing the budget of the open monitoring center for drugs and drugs addiction in two thousand fifteen	54	3
049_20140925.wav.pcm	20	I thank you very much for your attention, and obviously, I would be most happy to reply the questions to the questions you may, you might have. Thank you very much mister Kurz, emm that was an excellent presentation. What I said at the beginning, and quite a few members have come in since I made my introduction	58	2.9
238_20141016.wav.pcm	23	the entire council is leaving, so if you could go quietly, during the parliaments’ last mandate, the working documents have been presented by three previous rapporteurs, today the LIBE committee is going to hold an exchange reviews on all thee draft directives, so first we are going to hear from the council on the state of play, if any of them are remaining	63	2.73913043478261
240_20141016.wav.pcm	21	so I am going straight to Olympia Monaco now. (…) Good morning everyone, I am Olympia Monaco, I am a judge, I have been a public magistrate, and now I work for the ministry for justice, at the moment and we look at international	44	2.0952380952381
241_20141016.wav.pcm	18	legislation, and I’d like to thank you for the invitation to attend this meeting, it is an honor to be here today and to tell you about what we are doing in the council on the two proposals that we started to work on under our presidency.	47	2.61111111111111
242_20141016.wav.pcm	22	and then to tell you about the file on rights of minors and that was started under the Greek presidency with a first reading, now firstly I can say that the Italian presidency has supported and will support all of these three proposals, we think that they are very very important.	51	2.31818181818182
243_20141016.wav.pcm	15	we think it’s important to have a very high level of European legislation on the guarantees for procedural rights, and that’s one of our priorities, and this is why we are	31	2.06666666666667
244_20141016.wav.pcm	28	doing everything we can to conclude the negotiation on both of these directives, one on the presumption of innocence, and the (…) children, and we want to be able to wrap that up by December, by the end of our presidency. And we are also keen to work with you on the file for minors. I was an Italian delegate, that took part in negotiations under the Greek presidency on this. 	72	2.57142857142857
245_20141016.wav.pcm	18	we are hoping to start work with you on this file, there have been technical reasons connected to the recent elections which mean that we haven’t been able to start this formally with the parliament. But we are ready and we do want to do that as soon as possible.	50	2.77777777777778
246_20141016.wav.pcm	25	now, I’ll look at these three files, I will give you some information about the key points, and the key areas for discussion in council, I’ll start with  the presumption of innocence, because I chaired the working party on that, and I can tell you that this proposal has received a lot of support in the council.	58	2.32
247_20141016.wav.pcm	15	during the negotiations, there haven’t been any major specific problems, there aren’t technical legal issues that are difficult to deal with, that’s often the case whenever you are looking at 	31	2.06666666666667
248_20141016.wav.pcm	20	principles of case law coming from the European court, and we have had cooperation from the member states on the commission text here, and we hope that we can reach an agreement, that will be a general one on the text, at the moment we are currently looking at	49	2.45
129_20141106.wav.pcm	30	but the term national security is used in a wide range of laws, and indeed international agreements, as a a ground for exceptions to the rules, very often rules like fundamental rights, transparency, you know, citizens rights, legal protection, what have you. So if we have grounds for exceptions to our	51	1.7
130_20141106.wav.pcm	20	basic rights, then we should know, I mean that is a matter of legal centainty, we should know, exactly, what the grounds for those exceptions are, and, the thing is that if you use a term that has a different meaning, not only across the EU member states, but also in the countries that we have agreements with	58	2.9
131_20141106.wav.pcm	23	I mean, if we are talking about, very often it is not clear, we have international agreements, which which say, for reasons of national security we may have exceptions x y z, but the national security of which country, exactly? If we have an agreement, say , on the transfer of bank data or passenger data to the united states, and they give us certain legal safeguards	67	2.91304347826087
132_20141106.wav.pcm	17	except for, you know, when reasons of national security justify not applying those safeguards, but, does that mean that the national security of the united states actually define when European law applies to me?	34	2
133_20141106.wav.pcm	29	I mean, I’d really like to know, and again, if you, the one clear case I think where it is for the commission to give us a definition is safe harbor. Safe harbor is decided by the European commission. Not by the member states, not by the united states, not by parliament, y the commission, so surely, if the commission has such an important piece of, well, legislation, or or whatever you care to call it.	76	2.62068965517241
134_20141106.wav.pcm	23	and the commission itself decides, then it should be absolutely clear about the legal terms that it is using, so therefore I really feel, chair, that we should be discussing this further and we should insist that we get a full reply, a written reply by the legal service of the European commission and I I wouldn’t mind	58	2.52173913043478
135_20141106.wav.pcm	24	consulting the legal services of the council and the parliament, because the three institutions together pass legislation the whole time, well, it’s about time that we agree on the definition, even, even if the agreement would mean, the definitions as applied in the member states, but it should be absolutely clear to citizens when  our laws apply and when they don’t	62	2.58333333333333
136_20141106.wav.pcm	22	so we need this definition. Sophie, I mean, just to remind colleagues, and the, during the inquiry, the NSA inquiry, we agreed that this, just before I come to you Jan, we agreed that this definition, of national security was critical because, the national security definition for the individual member states under the treaty	54	2.45454545454545
137_20141106.wav.pcm	28	was their sole responsibility under article four. But when it comes to the cooperation between member states then it becomes a very gray area, it becomes a much more complicated situation, and of course, then it then it is a much more diluted and difficult situation, because we re we’re into into international agreements, so we need clarity on this, and with respect to what the legal services have said	70	2.5
138_20141106.wav.pcm	21	we probably need a much more nuanced and detailed position from them, so I agree with what you said, we need to stage this in a much more detailed way, so that is why I said open your (…) passionately, and you have done that, so thank you for doing that. Yeah, I know, you, you are also going to	60	2.85714285714286
063_20141110.wav.pcm	29	average, whatever de final results of this initiative, lets say that the signal is not quite encouraging, so I really support what already has been said, it is important to suspend the decision of the parliament. Thank you very much. The next is  madame Vergiat, from the GUE	49	1.68965517241379
079_20141110.wav.pcm	19	so, the intended balance between the specific objectives is maintained, the total funds available in the two thousand fourteen budget for the two programs are approximately one hundred million euros.	30	1.57894736842105
095_20141110.wav.pcm	18	our website has also been reorganized and redesigned in order to give a better overview of the different procedures, and we have received feedback from the different applicants, that eh they are really	33	1.83333333333333
111_20141110.wav.pcm	17	could you tell me if the figures I have are actually correct, and then there is two follow up questions. How is the commission going to prevent all forms violence, considering children and young people or women, given this significant reduction in funding	43	2.52941176470588
127_20141110.wav.pcm	24	too much, what is lagging behind in the financial programs with the pilot projects that you proposed to us and tried to help on this, and these pilot projects are quite important, I remember the pilot we did on training, for example with mister Belinguere and other members , and I remember also a project on sign language, again, where we gave our support	64	2.66666666666667
143_20141110.wav.pcm	26	according to the two evaluation the commission has carried out, one in two thousand thirteen and one in two thousand fourteen, which it, which it shared with you parliament and with the council.
